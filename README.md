# _JBinaryTree_

_Description: JBinaryTree is an implementation of a binary search tree in Java. The project started as an academic excercise, but soon, it was transformed to a full object oriented implementation for any developer wanting to use search binary trees. JBinaryTree supports the most common traversal algorithmns plus a reverse in order trasversal not present in the specifications, but very useful for programmers wanting to reverse traverse the tree._

## Project Setup

_Using JBinaryTree is simple. A sample implementaion on an <Integer,String> is privided as a template. Following is a snippet implementation:_ 

1. _What dependencies does it have (where are they expressed) and how do I install them?_
2. _How can I see the project working before I change anything?_

## Testing

_Testing the project depends on your custom implemntation. Debugging information is provided in the BinaryTree class to aide in troubleshooting. Logging framework have been excluded for performance reasons._

## Deploying

### _How to setup the deployment environment_

- _Required heroku addons, packages, or chef recipes._
- _Required environment variables or credentials not included in git._
- _Monitoring services and logging._

### _How to deploy_

## Troubleshooting & Useful Tools

_Examples of common tasks_

> e.g.
> 
> - How to make curl requests while authenticated via oauth.
> - How to monitor background jobs.
> - How to run the app through a proxy.
